# Classyfing-Rap-Subgenres-with-NLP
The goal of this project was to use natural language processing to answer a question: 

**Can rap lyrics be used to classify a subgenre of rap?**

This project used three algorithms: 
* neural network
* decision tree
* self-implemented K-nearest neighbor 

The dataset was originally taken from Kaggle, and then manually reduced to contain only the data I needed (rap lyrics, etc.). 

report_Andreikin.Nikita.pdf details the different steps of the project such as my approach, my dataset, experiments, results, and conclusion.

video_Andreikin.Nikita.txt contains a link to a youtube video which gives a brief summary of the project and the results. 

**TLDR: Not really, but it was a fun project.**
